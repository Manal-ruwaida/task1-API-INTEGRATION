DESCRIPTION ON WEATHER APP:
API Integration Task Description Using index.html and script.js
This task involves integrating a third-party API into a basic web application using two essential files: index.html and script.js. The goal is to fetch data from an external API and dynamically display the result in the browser without requiring a page reload. This task focuses on building a functional and user-friendly front-end experience by utilizing modern JavaScript features like fetch() and DOM manipulation.

Objective:
The primary objective is to create a simple, responsive web page that interacts with an external API. The page should allow the user to trigger an API request (e.g., by clicking a button) and display the received data directly on the page. This integration demonstrates key web development skills, including working with asynchronous JavaScript, API requests, and dynamically updating the Document Object Model (DOM).

File Overview:
index.html:
This file defines the structure and layout of the web page. It includes essential HTML elements such as headings, buttons, and a container (e.g., a <div> or <section>) where the fetched data will be displayed. It also links to the external JavaScript file (script.js) that contains the logic for fetching and rendering data.

script.js:
This JavaScript file contains all the logic necessary for API communication and DOM manipulation. It adds event listeners to HTML elements (e.g., buttons), uses the Fetch API to request data from an external source, handles asynchronous responses, manages error states, and injects the resulting data into the web page.
